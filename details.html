            Overview
        </h3>
        <p class="fs-5" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Yuji Itadori is the main protagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen, a kind-hearted but unnaturally strong teenager who
            becomes the vessel of the King of Curses, Ryomen Sukuna.
            Despite being thrown into the brutal world of jujutsu sorcery, Yuji holds tightly to his belief that people
            deserve a “proper death.”
            That belief, combined with his self-sacrificing nature, constantly puts him at odds with the system he’s
            forced to survive in.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Early Life
        </h4>
        <p class="fs-5" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Yuji was raised by his grandfather and lived a mostly normal life, attending school and keeping his head
            down despite his superhuman physical abilities.
            Before his death, Yuji’s grandfather warns him about his parents.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Season 1
        </h4>
        <p class="fs-5" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            After swallowing one of Sukuna’s fingers to save his classmates, Yuji becomes the vessel of Ryomen Sukuna.
            He is taken into custody by Jujutsu High and sentenced to execution, but is temporarily spared under the
            condition that he consumes all of Sukuna’s fingers first.
            Yuji begins training as a jujutsu sorcerer under Satoru Gojo and is placed on missions alongside Megumi
            Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki.
            He learns basic cursed energy control and combat while facing increasingly dangerous curses.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
            During a mission at a detention center, Sukuna forcibly takes control and kills Yuji, ripping out his heart.
            Yuji is later revived after agreeing to a binding vow with Sukuna. As the season continues, Yuji
            participates in the Kyoto Goodwill Event, where he fights against both curses and rival students.
            Season 1 ends with Yuji gaining more experience as a sorcerer while remaining under constant threat, both
            from Sukuna inside him and from the jujutsu authorities who still intend to execute him once his role is
            complete.
